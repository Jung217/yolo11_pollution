The dataset includes 659 images.
Pollute are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random shear of between -6째 to +6째 horizontally and -9째 to +9째 vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
